### Disclamer
The current directory contains independent jupyter notebooks with the code to webscrape and wrangle data for our project, this means no notebook depends on the other.  
However, only the "Webscrape\_and\_Wrangle.ipynb" notebook is required to run as it contains the code from all other notebooks and further refinements.
Therefore, "Webscrape\_and\_Wrangle.ipynb" should be considered the final product, containing the code required to webscrape the specified websites, and wrangle the data into the appropriate format.
