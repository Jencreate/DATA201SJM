# Information
The current directory contains multiple jupyter notebooks with the code to webscrape and wrangle data for our project.  
However, only the "Webscrape\_and\_Wrangle.ipynb" notebook is required to run as it contains the code from all other notebooks and further refinements.  
Therefore, "Webscrape\_and\_Wrangle.ipynb" should be considered the final product, containing the code required webscrape the specified websites, and wrangle the data into the appropriate format.
