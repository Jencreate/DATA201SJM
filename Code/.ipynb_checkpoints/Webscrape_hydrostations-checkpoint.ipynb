The Government completed a study of the suitability of the area for hydro electricity generation in 1906 and commenced work in 1911. In 1914 the power station was commissioned with three turbines and was then progressively expanded over the next decade. Much of the station still dates from this period. In 1930 the Acheron River was diverted into Lake Coleridge, increasing the catchment area to more than 800 square kilometres and in 1977 a diversion of the Wilberforce River further increased the amount of water, boosting average annual output to 205 GWh. The Coleridge power station is fed from Lake Coleridge via 2 kilometres of tunnels and pipes, and after passing through the powerhouse the water empties into the Rakaia River approximately 140 meters below the level of the Lake. Lake Coleridge can store 2 to 3 months inflows. TrustPower purchased Coleridge from ECNZ in October 1998 for $91 million and over the next two years upgraded the station at a cost of about $6 million. The investment increased capacity from 36 MW to 45 MW and target annual output from 205 GWh to 300 GWh. Resource consents to re-permit the existing scheme were granted in 1996 for a 35-year term to 2031. | NA | www.trustpower.co.nz, EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List) | NA | GEN.Hydro.Coleridge     |\n",

       "2 The Coleridge power station, about 100km inland from Christchurch, was New Zealand's first major hydropower scheme. The Government completed a study of the suitability of the area for hydro electricity generation in 1906 and commenced work in 1911. In 1914 the power station was commissioned with three turbines and was then progressively expanded over the next decade. Much of the station still dates from this period. In 1930 the Acheron River was diverted into Lake Coleridge, increasing the catchment area to more than 800 square kilometres and in 1977 a diversion of the Wilberforce River further increased the amount of water, boosting average annual output to 205 GWh. The Coleridge power station is fed from Lake Coleridge via 2 kilometres of tunnels and pipes, and after passing through the powerhouse the water empties into the Rakaia River approximately 140 meters below the level of the Lake. Lake Coleridge can store 2 to 3 months inflows. TrustPower purchased Coleridge from ECNZ in October 1998 for $91 million and over the next two years upgraded the station at a cost of about $6 million. The investment increased capacity from 36 MW to 45 MW and target annual output from 205 GWh to 300 GWh. Resource consents to re-permit the existing scheme were granted in 1996 for a 35-year term to 2031.\n",
       "3 The Highbank Power Station was constructed between 1939 and 1945 as part of a combined project to irrigate dry farmland and generate electricity.  Water for the station is collected from the Rangitata River by means of a 66km long irrigation race, which provides water for use by farms in summer, when demand for electricity is lower. In winter when electricity demand increases, and demand for irrigation water reduces, the water is used for power generation purposes. With an installed capacity of 25.2 MW, the Highbank scheme has an average annual output of 94 GWh. \\r\\rHighbank was previously grid connected (POC name : HBK0661 TRUS GG) but is now treated as embedded generation (POC name : HBK0661 TRUS EG behind ASB0661) for market purposes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "4 The Montalto Power Scheme had it's beginnings in 1958, when design work started on a project to generate electricity utilising the stepped flow of the Rangitata Diversion Race - an irrigation project completed in the early 1940's. Commissioning of the Montalto Power Station, which produces 1,100kW during irrigation season and 1,800 kW at other times was completed in 1982. Today the station has an annual output of 12GWh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Aniwhenua is named after the falls which are adjacent to the power house. The Aniwhenua scheme consists of a 200 meter long, 10 meter high dam structure with two radial control gates which can discharge 1,270 cubic meters of water per second. Three additional flap gates are designed to handle higher flood conditions. A 2.2 kilometer canal with a fall rate of 1 in 2,500 diverts water from the lake to a head pond above the powerhouse. Water flows from the head of the pond through steeply dropping penstocks at a rate of 75 cubic meters a second to the powerhouse. There, it drives two 12.5 MW generators before being discharged back to the river just below the Aniwhenua Falls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>NA</td><td>EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                           </td><td>NA</td><td>GEN.Hydro.Aniwhenua                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

Due to its close proximity to Hamilton's urban centre, Arapuni provides a voltage support role for power transmissions to the area. Recent upgrades to the station have enhanced its capability in this area. This station is occasionally used for frequency keeping. The Arapuni power station was the first government-built hydroelectric station on the Waikato River. During the initial surveying in 1916, an old watercourse was found just upstream of one of the narrowest parts of the gorge. In 1920, the surveying was halted due to lack of government funds to progress the project. \r",
       "Construction finally began in 1924, but repeated heavy rain and the resulting floods dogged the early works. Just after the project was commissioned in mid-1929, the station was closed for two years while a water seepage problem was investigated and the headrace lined. The station began operating again in May 1932 with four generators installed. Four more machines have since been added. In 2001, work was completed on four of Arapuni's turbines to increase capacity from 24.7MW to 26.7MW each and to improve their peak efficiency to 94 percent.</td><td>NA</td><td>EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List), www.mightyriverpower.co.nz                               </td><td> 7</td><td>GEN.Hydro.Waikato.Arapuni                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

There are a million cubic metres of concrete in the dam with another 200,000 cubic metres in the powerhouse. Before Lake Dunstan could be filled and the power station commissioned, a great deal of landslide stabilisation work was carried out behind the dam. Over 14 kilometres of tunnels were excavated into the hillsides to prevent water build-up that could destabilise the hillsides. Huge buttresses of compacted rock and gravel have been built to strengthen the hillsides and a total of 3,500 measuring and monitoring instruments have been installed around the lakeshore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>NA</td><td>EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                           </td><td>NA</td><td>GEN.Hydro.Clutha.Clyde                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

The Cobb station was built by the Government during the 1940s and 1950s and connected to the national grid in 1956. The station was put up for sale in 1999 following the carve-up of state-owned ECNZ into three companies - Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power and Genesis. NGC acquired the Cobb Valley station in 2000, when it bought TransAlta New Zealand. TransAlta had owned the station for just over a year, after buying it from Meridian Energy.  In March 2003 TrustPower completed the purchase of the Cobb hydro power station for $92.5m from NGC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </span></td><td>NA</td><td>www.trustpower.co.nz,PB 'Thermal &amp; Geothermal Generation Capabilities',Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)</td><td>NA</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>GEN.Hydro.Cobb                                                                                                                        </span></td></tr>\n",

Water from Lake Waikaremoana flows through the Kaitawa power station and into Lake Kaitawa before reaching the Tuai power station. From there it flows into the man-made Lake Whakamarino and through the Piripaua power station, before being released into the Waikaretaheke River and making its way to the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>NA</td><td>Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                                      </td><td>NA</td><td>GEN.Hydro.Waikaremoana                         </td></tr>\n",

At these times, the lake level fluctuates over a wide range. On other occasions, Waipapa is required to spill water past the station to accommodate upstream and downstream generation requirements. The volume of water flowing from the Maraetai station upstream, as well as the small reservoir size can create a 'bottleneck' in the Waikato hydro system. Capacity is normally 51MW, although under favourable hydrology conditions this may rise as high as 58.7MW (MRP website).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>NA</td><td>Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                                      </td><td> 6</td><td>GEN.Hydro.Waikato.Waipapa                      </td></tr>\n",

In 1998 TrustPower acquired the scheme from Dunedin City Council for $70 million. The Waipori hydro scheme is some 30 kilometres inland from Dunedin in the Lammerlaw Range. It comprises four individual dams and power stations that act in sequence with the powerhouses delivering output of 12 MW, 57 MW, 7 MW and 8 MW respectively as water descends down the Waipori River. The scheme is partially grid connected and partially embedded within the local line network. One of the units on the 2A station is switchable between the 33kv system (embedded) and the 110 kv system (31 MW is embedded, 34 MW is grid connected and 19MW can be switched betwen either). Grid connection bus is BWK1101 TRUS GG. Embedded bus is behind HWB0331.

       "Once steam has passed through the turbines it is condensed within 'direct contact' condensers. This cooling system uses water pumped from the adjacent Waikato River. After use, the cooling water and steam condensate is discharged back into the river. Gases found in the steam supply are pumped from the condenser and released to the air via gas stacks situated on the power station roof. The hot geothermal water is discharged into a system of drains (that lead to the Waikato River), or it is injected back into the ground.

The Wheao Hydro Electric Scheme, in the Kaingaroa forest is 82km from Rotorua, 25km from Murupara and 74km from Taupo. The 26MW scheme produces power using water from the Wheao and Rangitaiki Rivers as well as from Flaxy creek. Water from the the Rangitaiki River flows along a 4.7 kilometre open canal into the Wheao penstock intake. When a lot of power is needed the Flaxy Power Station supplements supply. A complex arrangement of canals, tunnels and pipelines feed the water from the upper Wheao River and Flaxy Creek to the Flaxy Power station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>NA</td><td>www.trustpower.co.nz,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                 </td><td>NA</td><td>GEN.Hydro.Wheao                                </td></tr>\n",

The scheme is run of the river. Water is collected from small intakes on the north and south branches of Wye Creek which fee 1350m of pipeline varying from 450mm to 600mm in diameter, which in turn supply a small power house downstream of the State Highway 6 road bridge. The scheme was upgraded in 1991 with the addition of a generator, turbine, renewal of penstocks, and foundations and exterior cladding of the powerhouse. The Wye Creek scheme has a peak generation output of 1.35 megawatts and an average energy production 10 Gigawatt hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>NA</td><td>Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                                      </td><td>NA</td><td>GEN.Hydro.WyeCreek                             </td></tr>\n",

Aniwhenua is named after the falls which are adjacent to the power house. The Aniwhenua scheme consists of a 200 meter long, 10 meter high dam structure with two radial control gates which can discharge 1,270 cubic meters of water per second. Three additional flap gates are designed to handle higher flood conditions. A 2.2 kilometer canal with a fall rate of 1 in 2,500 diverts water from the lake to a head pond above the powerhouse. Water flows from the head of the pond through steeply dropping penstocks at a rate of 75 cubic meters a second to the powerhouse. There, it drives two 12.5 MW generators before being discharged back to the river just below the Aniwhenua Falls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & NA & EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                            & NA & GEN.Hydro.Aniwhenua                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

Due to its close proximity to Hamilton's urban centre, Arapuni provides a voltage support role for power transmissions to the area. Recent upgrades to the station have enhanced its capability in this area. This station is occasionally used for frequency keeping. The Arapuni power station was the first government-built hydroelectric station on the Waikato River. During the initial surveying in 1916, an old watercourse was found just upstream of one of the narrowest parts of the gorge. In 1920, the surveying was halted due to lack of government funds to progress the project. \r",
       "Construction finally began in 1924, but repeated heavy rain and the resulting floods dogged the early works. Just after the project was commissioned in mid-1929, the station was closed for two years while a water seepage problem was investigated and the headrace lined. The station began operating again in May 1932 with four generators installed. Four more machines have since been added. In 2001, work was completed on four of Arapuni's turbines to increase capacity from 24.7MW to 26.7MW each and to improve their peak efficiency to 94 percent. & NA & EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List), www.mightyriverpower.co.nz                                &  7 & GEN.Hydro.Waikato.Arapuni                                                                                                             \\\\\n",

(Note : The reconcilation process models Atiamuri as a grid connected network rather than generation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & NA & EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                            &  3 & GEN.Hydro.Waikato.Atiamuri                                                                                                            \\\\\n",

There are a million cubic metres of concrete in the dam with another 200,000 cubic metres in the powerhouse. Before Lake Dunstan could be filled and the power station commissioned, a great deal of landslide stabilisation work was carried out behind the dam. Over 14 kilometres of tunnels were excavated into the hillsides to prevent water build-up that could destabilise the hillsides. Huge buttresses of compacted rock and gravel have been built to strengthen the hillsides and a total of 3,500 measuring and monitoring instruments have been installed around the lakeshore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & NA & EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                            & NA & GEN.Hydro.Clutha.Clyde                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

The Cobb station was built by the Government during the 1940s and 1950s and connected to the national grid in 1956. The station was put up for sale in 1999 following the carve-up of state-owned ECNZ into three companies - Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power and Genesis. NGC acquired the Cobb Valley station in 2000, when it bought TransAlta New Zealand. TransAlta had owned the station for just over a year, after buying it from Meridian Energy.

The scheme includes the Kaitawa (36MW), Tuai (60MW) and Piripaua (42MW) hydro stations, and is centrally controlled from Tuai. Water from Lake Waikaremoana flows through the Kaitawa power station and into Lake Kaitawa before reaching the Tuai power station. From there it flows into the man-made Lake Whakamarino and through the Piripaua power station, before being released into the Waikaretaheke River and making its way to the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & NA & Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                                       & NA & GEN.Hydro.Waikaremoana                         \\\\\n",

At these times, the lake level fluctuates over a wide range. On other occasions, Waipapa is required to spill water past the station to accommodate upstream and downstream generation requirements. The volume of water flowing from the Maraetai station upstream, as well as the small reservoir size can create a 'bottleneck' in the Waikato hydro system.

In 1998 TrustPower acquired the scheme from Dunedin City Council for \\$70 million. The Waipori hydro scheme is some 30 kilometres inland from Dunedin in the Lammerlaw Range. It comprises four individual dams and power stations that act in sequence with the powerhouses delivering output of 12 MW, 57 MW, 7 MW and 8 MW respectively as water descends down the Waipori River. The scheme is partially grid connected and partially embedded within the local line network. One of the units on the 2A station is switchable between the 33kv system (embedded) and the 110 kv system (31 MW is embedded, 34 MW is grid connected and 19MW can be switched betwen either). Grid connection bus is BWK1101 TRUS GG. Embedded bus is behind HWB0331.

Currently, about 5,000 tonnes per hour of fluid is taken from the reservoir. This is separated into roughly 1,500 tonnes per hour of steam and 3,500 tonnes per hour of water at a temperature of about 130°C. Dry steam is also taken from shallow production wells (up to 500 m depth) and piped directly to the turbines. The steam is directed towards the turbines through the network of pipes around the Wairakei steam field. \r",
       "Once steam has passed through the turbines it is condensed within 'direct contact' condensers. This cooling system uses water pumped from the adjacent Waikato River. After use, the cooling water and steam condensate is discharged back into the river. Gases found in the steam supply are pumped from the condenser and released to the air via gas stacks situated on the power station roof. The hot geothermal water is discharged into a system of drains (that lead to the Waikato River), or it is injected back into the ground. The Binary Plant uses heat energy in waste hot water to drive two 8 MW generators. However the binary plant needs about 2MW of power just to run its own pumps and fans so the overall generation is 14MW                                                & NA & EL Database,PB 'Thermal \\& Geothermal Generation Capabilities',Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List),www.nzgeothermal.org.nz & NA & GEN.Geothermal.Wairakei                        \\\\\n",

The Wheao Hydro Electric Scheme, in the Kaingaroa forest is 82km from Rotorua, 25km from Murupara and 74km from Taupo. The 26MW scheme produces power using water from the Wheao and Rangitaiki Rivers as well as from Flaxy creek. Water from the the Rangitaiki River flows along a 4.7 kilometre open canal into the Wheao penstock intake. When a lot of power is needed the Flaxy Power Station supplements supply. A complex arrangement of canals, tunnels and pipelines feed the water from the upper Wheao River and Flaxy Creek to the Flaxy Power station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & NA & www.trustpower.co.nz,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                  & NA & GEN.Hydro.Wheao                                \\\\\n",

The scheme is run of the river. Water is collected from small intakes on the north and south branches of Wye Creek which fee 1350m of pipeline varying from 450mm to 600mm in diameter, which in turn supply a small power house downstream of the State Highway 6 road bridge. The scheme was upgraded in 1991 with the addition of a generator, turbine, renewal of penstocks, and foundations and exterior cladding of the powerhouse. The Wye Creek scheme has a peak generation output of 1.35 megawatts and an average energy production 10 Gigawatt hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & NA & Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                                       & NA & GEN.Hydro.WyeCreek                             \\\\\n",

Aniwhenua is named after the falls which are adjacent to the power house. The Aniwhenua scheme consists of a 200 meter long, 10 meter high dam structure with two radial control gates which can discharge 1,270 cubic meters of water per second. Three additional flap gates are designed to handle higher flood conditions. A 2.2 kilometer canal with a fall rate of 1 in 2,500 diverts water from the lake to a head pond above the powerhouse. Water flows from the head of the pond through steeply dropping penstocks at a rate of 75 cubic meters a second to the powerhouse. There, it drives two 12.5 MW generators before being discharged back to the river just below the Aniwhenua Falls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | NA | EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                            | NA | GEN.Hydro.Aniwhenua                                                                                                                    |\n",

Due to its close proximity to Hamilton's urban centre, Arapuni provides a voltage support role for power transmissions to the area. Recent upgrades to the station have enhanced its capability in this area. This station is occasionally used for frequency keeping. The Arapuni power station was the first government-built hydroelectric station on the Waikato River. During the initial surveying in 1916, an old watercourse was found just upstream of one of the narrowest parts of the gorge. In 1920, the surveying was halted due to lack of government funds to progress the project. \r",
       "Construction finally began in 1924, but repeated heavy rain and the resulting floods dogged the early works. Just after the project was commissioned in mid-1929, the station was closed for two years while a water seepage problem was investigated and the headrace lined. The station began operating again in May 1932 with four generators installed. Four more machines have since been added. In 2001, work was completed on four of Arapuni's turbines to increase capacity from 24.7MW to 26.7MW each and to improve their peak efficiency to 94 percent. | NA | EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List), www.mightyriverpower.co.nz                                |  7 | GEN.Hydro.Waikato.Arapuni                                                                                                              |\n",

(Note : The reconcilation process models Atiamuri as a grid connected network rather than generation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | NA | EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                            |  3 | GEN.Hydro.Waikato.Atiamuri                                                                                                             |\n",

There are a million cubic metres of concrete in the dam with another 200,000 cubic metres in the powerhouse. Before Lake Dunstan could be filled and the power station commissioned, a great deal of landslide stabilisation work was carried out behind the dam. Over 14 kilometres of tunnels were excavated into the hillsides to prevent water build-up that could destabilise the hillsides. Huge buttresses of compacted rock and gravel have been built to strengthen the hillsides and a total of 3,500 measuring and monitoring instruments have been installed around the lakeshore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | NA | EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                            | NA | GEN.Hydro.Clutha.Clyde                                                                                                                 |\n",

The Cobb station was built by the Government during the 1940s and 1950s and connected to the national grid in 1956. The station was put up for sale in 1999 following the carve-up of state-owned ECNZ into three companies - Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power and Genesis. NGC acquired the Cobb Valley station in 2000, when it bought TransAlta New Zealand. TransAlta had owned the station for just over a year, after buying it from Meridian Energy.  In March 2003 TrustPower completed the purchase of the Cobb hydro power station for $92.5m from NGC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | NA | www.trustpower.co.nz,PB 'Thermal &amp; Geothermal Generation Capabilities',Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List) | NA | GEN.Hydro.Cobb                                                                                                                         |\n",

The scheme includes the Kaitawa (36MW), Tuai (60MW) and Piripaua (42MW) hydro stations, and is centrally controlled from Tuai. Water from Lake Waikaremoana flows through the Kaitawa power station and into Lake Kaitawa before reaching the Tuai power station. From there it flows into the man-made Lake Whakamarino and through the Piripaua power station, before being released into the Waikaretaheke River and making its way to the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | NA | Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                                       | NA | GEN.Hydro.Waikaremoana                          |\n",

Plans to increase capacity during 1943 were blocked due to Government wartime import restrictions. In 1996 a new 2,000 kw generator and turbine were installed to supplement one of the existing 500 kW units.

At these times, the lake level fluctuates over a wide range. On other occasions, Waipapa is required to spill water past the station to accommodate upstream and downstream generation requirements. The volume of water flowing from the Maraetai station upstream, as well as the small reservoir size can create a 'bottleneck' in the Waikato hydro system. Capacity is normally 51MW, although under favourable hydrology conditions this may rise as high as 58.7MW (MRP website).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | NA | Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                                       |  6 | GEN.Hydro.Waikato.Waipapa                       |\n",

The first electricity generation occurred in 1907 and development of the hydro capacity of the Waipori River has been ongoing ever since. In 1998 TrustPower acquired the scheme from Dunedin City Council for $70 million. The Waipori hydro scheme is some 30 kilometres inland from Dunedin in the Lammerlaw Range. It comprises four individual dams and power stations that act in sequence with the powerhouses delivering output of 12 MW, 57 MW, 7 MW and 8 MW respectively as water descends down the Waipori River. The scheme is partially grid connected and partially embedded within the local line network. One of the units on the 2A station is switchable between the 33kv system (embedded) and the 110 kv system (31 MW is embedded, 34 MW is grid connected and 19MW can be switched betwen either).

Currently, about 5,000 tonnes per hour of fluid is taken from the reservoir. This is separated into roughly 1,500 tonnes per hour of steam and 3,500 tonnes per hour of water at a temperature of about 130°C. Dry steam is also taken from shallow production wells (up to 500 m depth) and piped directly to the turbines. The steam is directed towards the turbines through the network of pipes around the Wairakei steam field. \r",
       "Once steam has passed through the turbines it is condensed within 'direct contact' condensers. This cooling system uses water pumped from the adjacent Waikato River. After use, the cooling water and steam condensate is discharged back into the river. Gases found in the steam supply are pumped from the condenser and released to the air via gas stacks situated on the power station roof. The hot geothermal water is discharged into a system of drains (that lead to the Waikato River), or it is injected back into the ground. The Binary Plant uses heat energy in waste hot water to drive two 8 MW generators. However the binary plant needs about 2MW of power just to run its own pumps and fans so the overall generation is 14MW                                                | NA | EL Database,PB 'Thermal &amp; Geothermal Generation Capabilities',Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List),www.nzgeothermal.org.nz | NA | GEN.Geothermal.Wairakei                         |\n",

The other part was built on the Canterbury (north) side of the river, with 11 sluice gates enabling water to flow through while the second section was being built on the Otago side. The station’s powerhouse was completed in 1934 after the dam was built. It was made of reinforced concrete and was 109 metres long. It was extended to 152 metres in the early 1950s to house the last set of new generators. The station’s first two generators were commissioned in 1935, and a third generator in 1940. Two more generators were installed in 1941 and 1949, bringing the station to its capacity of 75 MW. In 1952 the Pukaki and Tekapo water storage projects were finished, and the power station took advantage of the improved water flow. The station’s sixth and seventh generators – each 15 MW – were installed in 1954, and the station increased its capacity to the present-day level of 105 MW.

The Wheao Hydro Electric Scheme, in the Kaingaroa forest is 82km from Rotorua, 25km from Murupara and 74km from Taupo. The 26MW scheme produces power using water from the Wheao and Rangitaiki Rivers as well as from Flaxy creek. Water from the the Rangitaiki River flows along a 4.7 kilometre open canal into the Wheao penstock intake. When a lot of power is needed the Flaxy Power Station supplements supply. A complex arrangement of canals, tunnels and pipelines feed the water from the upper Wheao River and Flaxy Creek to the Flaxy Power station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | NA | www.trustpower.co.nz,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                  | NA | GEN.Hydro.Wheao                                 |\n",

The scheme is run of the river. Water is collected from small intakes on the north and south branches of Wye Creek which fee 1350m of pipeline varying from 450mm to 600mm in diameter, which in turn supply a small power house downstream of the State Highway 6 road bridge. The scheme was upgraded in 1991 with the addition of a generator, turbine, renewal of penstocks, and foundations and exterior cladding of the powerhouse. The Wye Creek scheme has a peak generation output of 1.35 megawatts and an average energy production 10 Gigawatt hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | NA | Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List)                                                                                       | NA | GEN.Hydro.WyeCreek                              |\n",

       "5   Constructed over three years at a cost of $27 million in the late 1970's, the Aniwhenua scheme involved the damming of the Rangitaiki River, forming a 255 hectare storage lake. Aniwhenua is named after the falls which are adjacent to the power house. The Aniwhenua scheme consists of a 200 meter long, 10 meter high dam structure with two radial control gates which can discharge 1,270 cubic meters of water per second. Three additional flap gates are designed to handle higher flood conditions. A 2.2 kilometer canal with a fall rate of 1 in 2,500 diverts water from the lake to a head pond above the powerhouse. Water flows from the head of the pond through steeply dropping penstocks at a rate of 75 cubic meters a second to the powerhouse. There, it drives two 12.5 MW generators before being discharged back to the river just below the Aniwhenua Falls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "6   With eight generating units, Arapuni has the largest single capacity of any of the stations in the Waikato hydro system. Due to its close proximity to Hamilton's urban centre, Arapuni provides a voltage support role for power transmissions to the area. Recent upgrades to the station have enhanced its capability in this area. This station is occasionally used for frequency keeping. The Arapuni power station was the first government-built hydroelectric station on the Waikato River. During the initial surveying in 1916, an old watercourse was found just upstream of one of the narrowest parts of the gorge. In 1920, the surveying was halted due to lack of government funds to progress the project. \\rConstruction finally began in 1924, but repeated heavy rain and the resulting floods dogged the early works. Just after the project was commissioned in mid-1929, the station was closed for two years while a water seepage problem was investigated and the headrace lined. The station began operating again in May 1932 with four generators installed. Four more machines have since been added. In 2001, work was completed on four of Arapuni's turbines to increase capacity from 24.7MW to 26.7MW each and to improve their peak efficiency to 94 percent.                                                              \n",

       "8   Investigations into the feasibility of Branch River Power scheme began in 1978, and following a detailed investigation in 1980 finance was approved with construction beginning soon afterwards. Canal filling commenced in March 1983, with generation commencing at the Wairau Power House in June, and at Argyle two months later.A run of the river scheme with daily storage, the water first passes through the Argyle station of 3800kw capacity with a head of 21.9 meters. A 3385 meter canal then carries the water to the Wairau Power Station of 7200kw at a head of 41.3 metres. CDS output data is believed to be net of some local load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "11  Construction was completed six months ahead of schedule and the station was commissioned early in November 1958. The additional generation from the Atiamuri station, together with the newly built Meremere coal-fired station, allowed post-war electricity restrictions in the North Island to be lifted by Christmas 1958. Although originally designed for three generators, a fourth was later added and commissioned in 1962.

       "29  Clyde is the largest concrete gravity dam in New Zealand. There are a million cubic metres of concrete in the dam with another 200,000 cubic metres in the powerhouse. Before Lake Dunstan could be filled and the power station commissioned, a great deal of landslide stabilisation work was carried out behind the dam. Over 14 kilometres of tunnels were excavated into the hillsides to prevent water build-up that could destabilise the hillsides. Huge buttresses of compacted rock and gravel have been built to strengthen the hillsides and a total of 3,500 measuring and monitoring instruments have been installed around the lakeshore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "30  Cobb is located in the Tasman Mountains northwest of Nelson, at the confluence of the Cobb and Takaka Rivers. The Cobb station was built by the Government during the 1940s and 1950s and connected to the national grid in 1956. The station was put up for sale in 1999 following the carve-up of state-owned ECNZ into three companies - Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power and Genesis. NGC acquired the Cobb Valley station in 2000, when it bought TransAlta New Zealand. TransAlta had owned the station for just over a year, after buying it from Meridian Energy.  In March 2003 TrustPower completed the purchase of the Cobb hydro power station for $92.5m from NGC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "196 The Tuai station draws water from the Lake Kaitawa and discharges into the man made Lake Whakamarino. The Waikaremoana Hydro Scheme is located between the remote Te Urewera National Park and Wairoa. The scheme includes the Kaitawa (36MW), Tuai (60MW) and Piripaua (42MW) hydro stations, and is centrally controlled from Tuai. Water from Lake Waikaremoana flows through the Kaitawa power station and into Lake Kaitawa before reaching the Tuai power station. From there it flows into the man-made Lake Whakamarino and through the Piripaua power station, before being released into the Waikaretaheke River and making its way to the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "200 Originally of 1,000 kW capacity, and intended to supply the entire Marlborough province, the Waihopai scheme was expanded to meet growing demand for electricity thorugh the installation of diesel generating sets in 1930 and 1937. Plans to increase capacity during 1943 were blocked due to Government wartime import restrictions. In 1996 a new 2,000 kw generator and turbine were installed to supplement one of the existing 500 kW units. This and other upgrade work has seen the scheme's maximum output increase from 1,000kw to 2,500 kW, with an annual generation output of 11.8 GWh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "201 As the smallest power station in the Waikato River hydro system, the role of Waipapa is to supplement the other stations during periods of heavy demand. At these times, the lake level fluctuates over a wide range. On other occasions, Waipapa is required to spill water past the station to accommodate upstream and downstream generation requirements. The volume of water flowing from the Maraetai station upstream, as well as the small reservoir size can create a 'bottleneck' in the Waikato hydro system. Capacity is normally 51MW, although under favourable hydrology conditions this may rise as high as 58.7MW (MRP website).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "202 The scheme's development was commenced in 1902 by the Waipori Falls Electric Power Company, which in 1904 was purchased by Dunedin City Council. The first electricity generation occurred in 1907 and development of the hydro capacity of the Waipori River has been ongoing ever since. In 1998 TrustPower acquired the scheme from Dunedin City Council for $70 million. The Waipori hydro scheme is some 30 kilometres inland from Dunedin in the Lammerlaw Range. It comprises four individual dams and power stations that act in sequence with the powerhouses delivering output of 12 MW, 57 MW, 7 MW and 8 MW respectively as water descends down the Waipori River. The scheme is partially grid connected and partially embedded within the local line network. One of the units on the 2A station is switchable between the 33kv system (embedded) and the 110 kv system (31 MW is embedded, 34 MW is grid connected and 19MW can be switched betwen either). Grid connection bus is BWK1101 TRUS GG. Embedded bus is behind HWB0331.

       "203 The Wairakei power plant is situated above a large geothermal system containing water at temperatures up to 240°C. Currently, about 5,000 tonnes per hour of fluid is taken from the reservoir. This is separated into roughly 1,500 tonnes per hour of steam and 3,500 tonnes per hour of water at a temperature of about 130°C. Dry steam is also taken from shallow production wells (up to 500 m depth) and piped directly to the turbines. The steam is directed towards the turbines through the network of pipes around the Wairakei steam field. \\rOnce steam has passed through the turbines it is condensed within 'direct contact' condensers. This cooling system uses water pumped from the adjacent Waikato River. After use, the cooling water and steam condensate is discharged back into the river. Gases found in the steam supply are pumped from the condenser and released to the air via gas stacks situated on the power station roof. The hot geothermal water is discharged into a system of drains (that lead to the Waikato River), or it is injected back into the ground. The Binary Plant uses heat energy in waste hot water to drive two 8 MW generators. However the binary plant needs about 2MW of power just to run its own pumps and fans so the overall generation is 14MW                                               \n",

A run of the river scheme with daily storage, the water first passes through the Argyle station of 3800kw capacity with a head of 21.9 meters. A 3385 meter canal then carries the water to the Wairau Power Station of 7200kw at a head of 41.3 metres.

The other part was built on the Canterbury (north) side of the river, with 11 sluice gates enabling water to flow through while the second section was being built on the Otago side. The station’s powerhouse was completed in 1934 after the dam was built. It was made of reinforced concrete and was 109 metres long. It was extended to 152 metres in the early 1950s to house the last set of new generators. The station’s first two generators were commissioned in 1935, and a third generator in 1940. Two more generators were installed in 1941 and 1949, bringing the station to its capacity of 75 MW. In 1952 the Pukaki and Tekapo water storage projects were finished, and the power station took advantage of the improved water flow. The station’s sixth and seventh generators – each 15 MW – were installed in 1954, and the station increased its capacity to the present-day level of 105 MW.

       "220 The Wheao and Flaxy scheme had it's beginnings in 1974, with the scheme being commissioned in 1980. The Wheao Hydro Electric Scheme, in the Kaingaroa forest is 82km from Rotorua, 25km from Murupara and 74km from Taupo. The 26MW scheme produces power using water from the Wheao and Rangitaiki Rivers as well as from Flaxy creek. Water from the the Rangitaiki River flows along a 4.7 kilometre open canal into the Wheao penstock intake. When a lot of power is needed the Flaxy Power Station supplements supply. A complex arrangement of canals, tunnels and pipelines feed the water from the upper Wheao River and Flaxy Creek to the Flaxy Power station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "225 Wye Creek was shut down in 2008 after a pressure build up caused the generator to hurle through a wall into the creek. The scheme is run of the river. Water is collected from small intakes on the north and south branches of Wye Creek which fee 1350m of pipeline varying from 450mm to 600mm in diameter, which in turn supply a small power house downstream of the State Highway 6 road bridge. The scheme was upgraded in 1991 with the addition of a generator, turbine, renewal of penstocks, and foundations and exterior cladding of the powerhouse. The Wye Creek scheme has a peak generation output of 1.35 megawatts and an average energy production 10 Gigawatt hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
