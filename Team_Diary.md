#### Team Entry (20/09/21)
- Attempted to generate ideas for the assignment topic (17/09/21) 
  - Each team member created a list of random words of any topic.
  - The words from each member were combined to form multiple sentences relating to a topic idea.
  - The ideas were further refined to meet the context of the assignment.

#### Team Entry (24/09/21)
- New team member in group, Liyinqin Li. SJM now has a group size of 4.
- 'energy production by river flow with rainfall' was chosen as the first topic for prototyping.
  - We found data for energy production by hydrostation, with the corresponding river flow data.
  - We could not find sufficient rain fall data over a long period of time for the locations of the hydrostations.  
- Changed our topic to our second choice 'energy production by riverflow with electricity cost' due to the above reason.

#### Team Entry (01/10/21)
- Found the data sets for power production by hydrostations, river flow, and electricity cost.
- Decided to use 2020 data for each of the above datasets as it was available for each subject.
